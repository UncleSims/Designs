This project is a one page design which i implemented during a one month training in react.
HTML AND VANILLA CSS as well as react were used.
<br/>
Design was implemented with less than one month knowledge of Javascript or react.<br/>
The react design, though created using react did not implement any functions.
I got off the training after a month because i was in Law school at the time but i am very much committed to learning react properly and improving my knowledge of Javascript.
